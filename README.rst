Overview
--------

GBRS is a suite of tools for reconstructing genomes using RNA-Seq data from multiparent population. It also quantifies allele specific expression.

* Free software: GPLv3 license
* Documentation: https://gbrs.readthedocs.org.

The same concept should work for any multiparent population. For the Diversity Outbred ([DO]: https://www.jax.org/strain/009376), Collaborative Cross (CC) mice, or F1 hybrids of CC's (CCRIX), required information files are available at ftp://churchill-lab.jax.org/pub/software/GBRS/.

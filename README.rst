Overview
--------

GBRS is a suite of tools for reconstructing genomes using RNA-Seq data from multiparent population. It also quantifies allele specific expression. GBRS should work for any multiparent populations although we only tested it with mouse models. For the Diversity Outbred (DO https://www.jax.org/strain/009376), Collaborative Cross (CC) mice, or F1 hybrids of CC's (CCRIX), required information files are available at ftp://churchill-lab.jax.org/pub/software/GBRS/.
